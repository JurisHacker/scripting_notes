First make the list (across) on a sheet named tbl_data.  The formula below assums you are starting on B2.  Define a "name" categories:

Refers to: =tbl_data!$B$2:INDEX(tbl_data!$2:$2,,COUNTA(tbl_data!$2:$2)+1)

Then select your "B2" above and define a name "choice"

Refers to: =IF(ISBLANK(!A2),Categories,OFFSET(INDEX(Categories,,MATCH(!A2,Categories,)),1,, COUNTA(OFFSET(INDEX(Categories,,MATCH(!A2,Categories,)),1,,100))))

Then setup data validation:  Select the cells you want validated, then 

Source:  =Choice
